        <p>
            We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for
            any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
            All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
            termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and
            limitations of liability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Service may contain links to third­party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled

        </p>
        <p>
            Questor GmbH has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content,
            privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and
            agree that My Company, Inc. (change this) shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for
            any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on
            any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.

        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
            rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
            agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we
            might have between us regarding the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
            revision is material we will try to provide at least 10 days notice prior to any new terms
            taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
