With StoryQuest, you can create adventure e-books and interactive fiction that contain branching 
storylines, audio, images, illustrations, video, and interactive JavaScript-based content. 
StoryQuest delivers ready-to-deploy app archives in a platform-independend format. Clients 
are available for Android, FireOS and iOS. Support for e-readers like Kindle or Kobo is 
available soon.

StoryQuest is the driving platform for the Questor Books available on Google Play and Apple App 
Store with titles including "Markus Heitz's The Dwarfs", "The Lone Wolf" and "Dark Orbit".

StoryQuest is currently in development and has reached beta stage. Feel free to comment or try.
Caution: documentation is somewhat sparse at the moment, we're working on this.
